## [Unreleased]

- Upgraded Ethers to 0.5.2 and disabled default features to allow for building on Windows (which lacks IPC support, see https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/issues/393)

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- Revert reason is now parsed, if there is any.

### Fixed

- `value` on a simulated transaction was incorrectly assumed to be
  the amount of Ether sent in a transaction. It is now correctly
  parsed as `Bytes`, since it represents the return data (if any)
  of the transaction.

## [0.4.0]

### Changed

- Parameters are now validated before bundles are sent to the relay.
  Check [the documentation](https://docs.rs/ethers-flashbots/0.4.0/ethers_flashbots/enum.FlashbotsMiddlewareError.html#variant.MissingParameters) for more information.
- Bumped ethers to 0.5.1

### Added

- Added a helper to get the effective gas price of bundles and
  bundle transactions (`SimulatedBundle::effective_gas_price` and `SimulatedTransaction::effective_gas_price`).

## [0.3.1]

### Added

- Added a way to get stats about bundles (`FlashbotsMiddleware::get_bundle_stats`)
- Added a getter for the bundle hash of a pending bundle
- Added a way to get stats about your searcher identity (`FlashbotsMiddleware::get_user_stats`)

## [0.3.0]

### Fixes

- If your bundle contains a transaction that deploys a contract,
  the `SimulatedTransaction` will now have a destination (`to`) of
  `None` to distinguish this from the zero address.

## [0.2.2]

### Fixes

- Handle non-JSONRPC errors from the Flashbots relay

## [0.2.1]

### Fixes

- Correctly serializes bundle requests

## [0.2.0]

**NOTE**: This release is unfortunately broken, please update to [0.2.1]

### Added

- You can now wait for bundle inclusions (see `PendingBundle`).
- Added `BundleRequest::transaction_hashes`

## [0.1.3]

**NOTE**: This release is unfortunately broken, please update to [0.2.1]

### Added

- Added a revert reason to simulated transactions

## [0.1.2]

**NOTE**: This release is unfortunately broken, please update to [0.2.1]
