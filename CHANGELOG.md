## [Unreleased]

- Fix simulation for broadcaster middleware (#58)
- Added support for `replacementUuid` field in `eth_sendBundle`

## [0.14.0]

### Added

- Added a broadcaster middleware (#54)

## [0.13.1]

### Fixed

- Check the entire block to determine bundle inclusion. See #47 for more detail.

## [0.13.0]

### Added

- Added `add_transaction` and `add_revertible_transaction` (#46)

### Changed

- Bumped `ethers` to `2.0.0` and fixed middleware breaking changes

## [0.12.1]

### Fixed

- Handle optional fields in the response of `flashbots_getBundleStatsV2`.

## [0.12.0]

### Added

- It is now possible to use your own endpoint for simulating bundles. Bundles will be sent over JSON-RPC to the given endpoint. The JSON-RPC method used is `eth_callBundle`. See `Middleware::set_simulation_relay`.

### Changed

- The library now uses the new `flashbots_getUserStatsV2` and `flashbots_getBundleStatsV2` endpoints. **If you need the old endpoints, pin your version to 0.11.0.**

## [0.11.0]

### Changed

- Addd a `rustls` feature flag to use native TLS over OpenSSL
- Bumped `thiserror` to `1.0.37`
- Bumped `chrono` to `0.4.22`
- Bumped `url` to `2.3.1`
- Bumped `async-trait` to `0.1.58`
- Bumped `ethers` to `1.0.0`

## [0.10.0]

- Replaced `anyhow` with `eyre`
- Updated to ethers `^0.17.0`

## [0.9.0]

### Changed

- Updated to ethers `^0.13.0`

## [0.8.2]

### Added

- `Debug` is now implemented for `UserStats` and `BundleStats`

### Changed

- `PendingBundle::bundle_hash()` is now deprecated

## [0.8.1]

A small patch to fix the documentation on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs).

## [0.8.0]

### Added

- The basefee for a simulated block can now be specified.

## [0.7.0]

### Changed

- Updated to ethers `^0.6.0`

## [0.6.0]

### Changed

- Relaxed version requirement for Ethers - version requirement is now `^0.5.0`.
- Disabled default Ethers features to allow for building on Windows (which lacks IPC support, see https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/issues/393)

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- Revert reason is now parsed, if there is any.

### Fixed

- `value` on a simulated transaction was incorrectly assumed to be
  the amount of Ether sent in a transaction. It is now correctly
  parsed as `Bytes`, since it represents the return data (if any)
  of the transaction.

## [0.4.0]

### Changed

- Parameters are now validated before bundles are sent to the relay.
  Check [the documentation](https://docs.rs/ethers-flashbots/0.4.0/ethers_flashbots/enum.FlashbotsMiddlewareError.html#variant.MissingParameters) for more information.
- Bumped ethers to 0.5.1

### Added

- Added a helper to get the effective gas price of bundles and
  bundle transactions (`SimulatedBundle::effective_gas_price` and `SimulatedTransaction::effective_gas_price`).

## [0.3.1]

### Added

- Added a way to get stats about bundles (`FlashbotsMiddleware::get_bundle_stats`)
- Added a getter for the bundle hash of a pending bundle
- Added a way to get stats about your searcher identity (`FlashbotsMiddleware::get_user_stats`)

## [0.3.0]

### Fixes

- If your bundle contains a transaction that deploys a contract,
  the `SimulatedTransaction` will now have a destination (`to`) of
  `None` to distinguish this from the zero address.

## [0.2.2]

### Fixes

- Handle non-JSONRPC errors from the Flashbots relay

## [0.2.1]

### Fixes

- Correctly serializes bundle requests

## [0.2.0]

**NOTE**: This release is unfortunately broken, please update to [0.2.1]

### Added

- You can now wait for bundle inclusions (see `PendingBundle`).
- Added `BundleRequest::transaction_hashes`

## [0.1.3]

**NOTE**: This release is unfortunately broken, please update to [0.2.1]

### Added

- Added a revert reason to simulated transactions

## [0.1.2]

**NOTE**: This release is unfortunately broken, please update to [0.2.1]

### Changed

- Pinned ethers dependencies to specific versions

## [0.1.1]

**NOTE**: This release is unfortunately broken, please update to [0.2.1]
